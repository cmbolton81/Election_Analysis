 ### Election Summary
 We think this scriped would be great for a Mayoral race and school referendum. With the Mayoral race it would be got because you would be able to easily get the votes for more canidates. The nice thing with the script and doing it with the school referendum is you can find out which part of the school area is voting for which way. In the end this script would be able to help with any audit on any election or vote.
